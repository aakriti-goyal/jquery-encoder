h1. What is jqencoder

jqencoder is a jQuery plugin whose goal is to provide jQuery developers with a means
to do contextual output encoding on untrusted data. As applications become more and more
reliant on rich client technologies the need for client-side code to have the ability
to properly escape untrusted data becomes exponentially more important.

h1. Usage

Using the plugin is very simple, there are both static and instance methods to provide
the right type of output encoding for your current situation. The plugin also provides
a canonicalization method, which is imperative for detecting attacks that use double or
multi encoding when handling data from an untrusted source. If you are dealing with data
that may contain encoding, you can first canonicalize that data, then re-encode it for
the appropriate context.

<pre lang="ruby">
<script type="text/javascript">
    $.post( 'http://untrusted.com/webservice', { parameter1: 'value' }, function(data) {
        // Data returned may contain encoded data, so canonicalize the data to it's simplest
        // form prior to encoding it for use on the page.
        var cdata = $.canonicalize(data);
        $('#element').encode('html', cdata);
    });
</script>
</pre>
